My name is Jiangyan Ma (George Ma). I am an undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in Information and Computing Science. I am interested in machine learning theories and applications, and am currently doing research on graph learning at Prof. Yisen Wang's lab. I am particularly interested in invariant and universal neural networks. My email: [georgem@stu.pku.edu.cn](mailto:georgem@stu.pku.edu.cn). My CV: [Jiangyan Ma's CV](https://georgemlp.github.io/cv). I actively write blogs on Zhihu: [George M's Zhihu Homepage](https://www.zhihu.com/people/george-m-55).
