Laplacian eigenvectors offer universal expressive power as a graph positional encoding technique. However, they also suffer from uncertainties related to sign and basis. In our research, we uncovered that achieving permutation equivariance, sign/basis invariance, and universality simultaneously in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not possible. To address this challenge, we developed the *Laplacian Canonization* algorithm that eliminates the sign and basis ambiguities of Laplacian eigenvectors. We further established the necessary and sufficient conditions for canonizing Laplacian eigenvectors into a canonical form. Our work on Laplacian Canonization was accepted as a poster at NeurIPS 2023.
